During all which , those knights continued there ,
Both doing and receiving courtesies ,
Of that great Lady , who with goodly cheer
Them entertained , fit for their dignities ,
Approving daily to their noble eyes
Royal examples of her mercies rare ,
And worthy patterns of her clemencies ;
Which till this day mongst many living are ,
Who them to their posterities do still declare .

During all which, those knights continu’d there,
Both doing and receiuing curtesies,
Of that great Ladie, who with goodly chere
Them entertayn’d, fit for their dignities,
Approuing dayly to their noble eyes
Royall examples of her mercies rare,
And worthie paterns of her clemencies;
Which till this day mongst many liuing are,
Who them to their posterities doe still declare.
